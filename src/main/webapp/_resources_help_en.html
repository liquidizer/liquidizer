  <!-- Introduction to Liquidizer-->
  <res name="Intro">
    The Liquidizer is a highly interactive online platform for
    political discussion and ongoing opinion polling. Its focus lies
    in the simplicity of the voting system and the rich visual
    feedback displaying current interests, trends and
    interdependencies. The system provides swift and precise feedback
    to the user's expression of preferences. Optimizing their impact
    on the polling result users must allocate a limited total voting
    weight. This leads to a game like experience where the formation
    of allys and coordinated voting tactics can reveal the innate
    structure of rivalling political fractions along side each
    participant's political profile.

  <!-- Casting Votes -->

  <res name="VotingIntro">
    The voting system of the Liquidizer is based on limited overall,
    such that participation on each query must be well balanced.  The
    maximal weight which can be used to support (or reject) a
    proposition is 1.  If a user supports multiple propositions, the
    voting weight on each proposition is reduced. To optimize voting
    influence, you need to log in at regular intervals and pay close
    attention to what propositions you support. The total voting
    weight also decreases over time when you do not log into the
    system, such that the influence slackers and dead accounts is
    diminished.
  </res>
  <res name="VotingPreferences">
    The user can express her preferences for individual queries on
    scale between -3 and 3.  By clicking on a positive number you
    declare your support for a proposition, by clicking a negative
    value you reject it. The preferences are not directly visible to
    other users, but they define the proportions between your limited
    total voting weights.
  </res>
  <res name="VotingDelegates">
    Your can also assign a positive preferences to other users, in
    which case you delegate a part of your voting weight. Based on
    delegation strength between 0 and 3 this user's votes will be
    considered in the calculation of your final voting weights.
  </res>
  <res name="EditingText">
    The most influential strategy to gain support for your political
    initiative still consists in placing a good argument.  All places
    that show this edit icon can be commented by the user who is
    logged in. Except mail addresses, postings are visible to all.
    <br/> The texts you type can include links. To create a list, type
    an asterisk (*) at the beginning of each new row. The html tags
    &lt;img&gt;, &lt;em&gt;, and &lt;code&gt; are allowed.

    The Potency component shows how many topics you and the selected
    user have in common (i.e. you both voted on them), independent of
    the positions on that topics.

    The Distance component shows how you and the selected user

  <res name="SystemIntro1">
   The voting system of Liquidizer is optimized from a
   game-theoretic point of view. As each user's voting weight is
   limited, they have to optimize their influence to achieve a
   favorbale result. There is no time limit on polls. Thus, the final
   goal is not to "win", but to make ideas, proposals and topics more
   visible.
  </res>
  <res name="SystemIntro2">
    The voting weight of a user on a single topic lies between -1 and
    1. The sum of the weights' squares across all topics is equal to
    1. Thus, if you vote on a high number of topics, your vote's
    weight on each one will be low (e.g., you can participate in 100
    topics with a weight of 0.1 each, as 0.1Â² = 0.01). If a topic is
    important or controversial and you want to influence it more
    strongly, you may choose to vote on that topic only (then the
    weight of your vote will become 1).
  </res>
  <res name="SystemExample1">
    In the following example, users A and B participate in the polls
    on three topics. A is indifferent about topic 1, is strongly in
    favor of topic 2 and rejects topic 3. B favors all three topics,
    with A being most important.
  </res>
  <res name="SystemExample2">
    When A votes according to his preferences, the voting weights for
    the respective topics will be 0, 0.95 and -0.32, as
  </res>
  <res name="SystemExample3">
    B's voting weights will be 0.91, 0.18 und 0.37:
  </res>
  <res name="SystemExample4">
    The voting weight's ratios are equal to the preference ratios, but
    the weights are limited by the constraint on their absolute value:
  </res>
  <res name="SystemExample5">
    In this example, both A and B "waste" a part of their limited
    voting weight. Their votes on topic 3 "cancel out", so both can
    increase their influence by shifting more weight onto topics they
    agree upon.
  </res>
  <res name="SystemExample6">
    If both A and B decide to change their voring behaviour to
    (1,1,0), both will be better visible in the results:
  </res>
  <res name="VotingCooperation">
    Thus, it is worthwhile to look for allies with similar
    positions. You may, for example, delegate your vote to another
    user and look whether your resulting voting behaviour is still
    acceptable.

  <res name="AnalysisToolsIntro">
    The following analysis tools are available on a topic's detail
    page. They provide in depth visual feedback about the voters'
    behaviour. This might be usefull to understand trends or to
    discover frauds.
  </res>
  <res name="ChartsIntro">
    Charts show the history of votes on a topic. The line at the top
    shows the history of positive votes and the line on the bottom
    shows the negative votes (weighted). The sum in the middle is
    shown yellow (if it's positive) or red (if negative). As voting
    weights decrease with time, the trend lines converge towards 0 if
    users do not refresh their votes.
  </res>
  <res name="HistogramIntro">
    The histogram shows how many users are participating in a poll and
    what intensities (preferences) they have. All votes have a weight
    between -1 and +1, but only few users would spend all their weight
    on a single topic. Thus, lower weights in the center of the graph
    are more common.
  </res>
  <res name="DelegationGraphIntro">
    The delegation graph shows the influence of delegations on your
    votes. You may choose multiple users to whom you delegate, in
    which case your resulting voting weights will be cast as a
    average of your delegates.  Even if you have delegated
    your vote, you need to log in to check your resulting voting
    behaviour regularly, otherwise your voting weight will decrease
    with time.
